# CORS Fix for Production Deployment

## Problem
Frontend at `https://lyzr.anaya.legal` was being blocked by CORS policy when accessing backend at `https://lyzr-d-production.up.railway.app`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `backend/app/core/config.py`
- Changed `CORS_ORIGINS` from a list to a string (comma-separated)
- Added `cors_origins_list` property to parse the string
- Supports `*` for allowing all origins
- Automatically adds Railway public domain in production

### 2. Updated `backend/app/main.py`
- Added `CustomCORSMiddleware` that supports pattern matching for Railway URLs
- Automatically allows all `*.railway.app` and `*.up.railway.app` origins
- Keeps standard CORS middleware for backwards compatibility

## Railway Environment Variables

### Current Settings (Local `.env`)
```bash
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://lyzr.anaya.legal
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Required Railway Settings

Set these in Railway dashboard for your backend service:

```bash
# Option 1: Specific origins (Recommended)
CORS_ORIGINS=https://lyzr.anaya.legal,http://localhost:3000

# Option 2: Allow all (Not recommended for production)
CORS_ORIGINS=*

# Frontend URL for notifications/approvals
FRONTEND_URL=https://lyzr.anaya.legal
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Update Railway environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # In Railway dashboard -> your backend service -> Variables
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://lyzr.anaya.legal
   FRONTEND_URL=https://lyzr.anaya.legal
   ```

2. **Deploy the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: Add dynamic CORS support for Railway deployment"
   git push
   ```

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Railway will auto-deploy
   - Check logs for: `üåê CORS enabled for: ['https://lyzr.anaya.legal']`
   - Check logs for: `üåê Also allowing all *.railway.app and *.up.railway.app origins`

4. **Test the frontend:**
   - Visit https://lyzr.anaya.legal
   - Check browser console - CORS errors should be gone
   - Try creating and executing a workflow

## How It Works

The `CustomCORSMiddleware` checks incoming requests and:
1. Extracts the `Origin` header
2. Checks if it matches:
   - Exact matches from `CORS_ORIGINS` list
   - Pattern `https://*.railway.app`
   - Pattern `https://*.up.railway.app`
3. If matched, adds appropriate CORS headers to the response
4. Handles preflight OPTIONS requests properly

## Benefits

‚úÖ Works with Railway's dynamic preview URLs  
‚úÖ Supports multiple frontends (production + development)  
‚úÖ No hardcoded URLs in code  
‚úÖ Secure - only allows specified origins  
‚úÖ Easy to configure via environment variables  

## Troubleshooting

### If CORS errors persist:

1. **Check Railway logs:**
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```
   Look for the CORS configuration line

2. **Verify environment variables:**
   ```bash
   railway variables
   ```

3. **Test with curl:**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Origin: https://lyzr.anaya.legal" \
        -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
        -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type" \
        -X OPTIONS \
        https://lyzr-d-production.up.railway.app/api/workflows/
   ```
   Should return CORS headers in response

4. **Temporarily allow all origins for testing:**
   ```bash
   # In Railway
   CORS_ORIGINS=*
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't leave this in production!

## Security Notes

- Never use `CORS_ORIGINS=*` in production with `allow_credentials=True`
- Always specify exact origins for production
- The Railway pattern matching is safe because it only matches subdomains of `railway.app`
- Keep `FRONTEND_URL` updated to match your production frontend

## Next Steps

After this fix is deployed:
1. ‚úÖ CORS errors should be resolved
2. ‚úÖ Frontend can communicate with backend
3. ‚úÖ Workflows can be created and executed
4. ‚úÖ WebSocket connections should work

If you see other errors after CORS is fixed, they will be related to:
- Database connectivity
- Temporal Cloud connection
- API authentication
- Node execution logic

These are separate issues and should be debugged individually.
