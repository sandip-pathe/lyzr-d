## üí° Usage Examples

### Export a Workflow:
1. Design your workflow
2. Click Download icon in toolbar
3. JSON file downloads automatically
4. Share with teammates or backup

### Import a Workflow:
1. Click Upload icon in toolbar
2. Select .json file
3. Workflow loads onto canvas
4. Edit and save as needed

### Pause/Resume Execution:
1. Start workflow execution
2. Click Pause button (orange) if needed
3. Workflow pauses at current node
4. Click Resume button (green) to continue
5. Execution picks up where it left off

### Retry Failed Workflow:
1. Workflow execution fails
2. Retry button (blue) appears
3. Click Retry
4. New execution starts with same input
5. Previous errors cleared

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Import Overwrites**: Importing replaces current canvas (no merge option)
2. **No Version Tracking**: Can't see what changed between exports
3. **Pause Timing**: Pauses after current node completes (not mid-execution)
4. **Export Format**: No validation of exported JSON structure yet
5. **Progress Accuracy**: Based on node count, not execution time
